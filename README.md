# OOP Project - Investigating Thermodynamic Systems with a 2D Simulation of a Gas #

This was my coursework for Year 2 Computing Labs - obtaining a grade of 75%. The project involved making a 2D simulation of a gas using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The simulation was run with scripts to ensure it follows physical limits and to derive fundamental thermodynamic equations for non-ideal gas systems. The accuracy of OOP in simulating this thermodynamic system was also explored.

## Organisation ##
The repository contains:
- The report submitted for the coursework `./ga3118_labs_cycle2_lab_report.pdf`
- The main source code containing the simulation classes and methods for the thermodynamic gas `./simulation.py`
- A script that runs the simulations and produces graphs to visualise the outputs `./testing_simulation.py`
- A file that tests the simulation for a gas with 'balls' of half the size of a hydrogen atom `./pressure_laws_H0_5.py`
- A file that tests the simulation for a gas with 'balls' the size of a hydrogen atom `./pressure_laws_H1.py`
- A file that tests the simulation for a gas with 'balls' the size of 2 hydrogen atoms `./pressure_laws_H2.py`
- A file that produces plots that show specfic aspects of the simulation to check how OOP is implemented in the context of this gas simulation `./plotting.py`
- A file that tests the simulation for a gas testing VanDerWaals conditions `./vanderwaals.py`
- A folder containing all the graphs produced and shown in the coursework report `./final_graphs`
- A folder containing graphs produced from preliminary experiments of the simulation `./previous_trials`
